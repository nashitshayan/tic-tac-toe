## Description
> A Tic-Tac-Toe game you can play in your browser! Currently, it only supports player vs player functionality. Players can enter thier names and marker choice. 

## Learnings
1. Understanding the factory function pattern and the module (IIFE) pattern.
2. Understadning scope and closure.
3. Understanding the use of private functions and variables.

## Technologies used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. vanillaJS

## Challenges I faced
1. The goal was to have as little global code as possible. So I was tasked to tuck away everything is either a factory or a module (IIFE). Figuring out what goes where was the crux of this project.
2. Got many bugs after implementing the initial functionality.
3. Adding the feature for players to add their names and choose their markers was the hardest part to nail and I kept getting many bugs when trying to get it working properly.

## Room for improvement
1. Adding an AI opponent is the first obvious improvemennt that comes to mind.
2. The UI can be improved, especially for mobile. I tried to make it responsive for mobile but a good improvement would be to have the gameboard only display AFTER players have entered their names and chosen their markers.
